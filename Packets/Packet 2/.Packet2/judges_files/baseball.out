holy cow
last night he hit 2 out of 3 (0.667) 
but last week he only hit 3 for 11 (0.273) 
last month the club hit only 24 out of 140 (0.171) which 
was the worst out of all teams in the league
I can hit 1 for 4 (0.250) if I try to 
or I can bat 7 out of 8 (0.875) if I really, really try to 
abcdefghijk 3 out of 3 (1.000) LMNOP
